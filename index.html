                        Jennifer was a reliable and efficient marketing executive at Centaur. She could multi-task
                        effectively and had a good understanding of the markets we were operating in. In her role she
                        managed more than one campaign at a time and multiple elements within those campaigns too.
                        Campaigns consisted of the complete marketing mix from online to print and occasionally some
                        telemarketing. The role demanded good people skills as well as strong B2B marketing ability.
